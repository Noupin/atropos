[7.65 -> 13.44] you're watching KF AF it's the show that
[9.96 -> 14.88] your mom [ __ ] yeah she's just walking
[13.44 -> 17.91] by this right now thinking to herself
[14.88 -> 19.62] what have I done with my son
[17.91 -> 21.21] should I just throw him out the window
[19.62 -> 23.46] and start over you know my my mommy
[21.21 -> 25.86] anyone's mom yeah I guess yeah
[23.46 -> 27.90] just a general sort of like an
[25.86 -> 29.10] all-encompassing mom yeah yeah like a
[27.90 -> 30.60] mom that's like you know like here
[29.10 -> 31.83] because I have a older brother who
[30.60 -> 33.96] everyone's always disappointing with and
[31.83 -> 37.38] then and my mom's always like we can't
[33.96 -> 38.67] say anything about him but she's the one
[37.38 -> 40.98] you know what I mean should we have hit
[38.67 -> 43.68] the reset right well I love you Maddie

[58.17 -> 61.80] look up to him still to this day kicks
[60.00 -> 63.63] ass to this day but the read the reason
[61.80 -> 66.30] why I really respect him is because he
[63.63 -> 68.67] went through the gauntlet instead of me
[66.30 -> 71.06] he did all the mistakes and I was like
[68.67 -> 73.62] oh let me just take him out right here
[71.06 -> 74.07] that's Oh drunk driving yeah let's not
[73.62 -> 76.92] do that

[76.92 -> 78.90] relationships we get engaged you were
[78.18 -> 80.25] late too young
[78.90 -> 81.96] yeah that's not good it's like when
[80.25 -> 83.70] someone goes when you're going golfing
[81.96 -> 85.35] and you want the person in front of you

[123.81 -> 128.72] basically Game of Thrones with rabbits
[125.49 -> 132.75] if they're all right if a Netflix people
[128.72 -> 133.59] versus Noah Felicio I'm sure there will
[132.75 -> 135.00] be some rabbit
[133.59 -> 136.32] the problem that we'll play shows you
[135.00 -> 136.86] have to show your soft underbelly when

[136.86 -> 140.73] mmm because they can't stand yeah really
[139.26 -> 143.22] is that true well they have to go like
[140.73 -> 145.44] this and then they like oh those were
[143.22 -> 149.67] like the actual like guidelines that
[145.44 -> 150.66] Netflix may set for televised fellatio
[149.67 -> 153.51] oh I don't know I don't think Netflix
[150.66 -> 155.52] has guidelines do they have guidelines I
[153.51 -> 157.98] see some real [ __ ] up show on Netflix
[155.52 -> 159.69] can Castlevania this by the way why

[164.04 -> 166.29] how to create a separate account oh she
[165.51 -> 168.45] probably won't know how to use a
[166.29 -> 170.52] separate account or and she'll see every
[168.45 -> 172.62] single movie that I watch just fast
[170.52 -> 174.75] forwarded right after the sexy hentai oh

[196.50 -> 199.50] greatest show on the Internet tell all

[211.02 -> 214.04] like hey we're playing a video game we
[212.64 -> 216.75] put a lot of time and effort into this
[214.04 -> 218.13] that's done it's passe yeah what we're
[216.75 -> 219.36] gonna do on the show okay the new world
[218.13 -> 220.71] welcome to the new world we have a lot
[219.36 -> 224.58] of fun things planned for you guys today
[220.71 -> 225.63] not the least of which is Andy we're
[224.58 -> 226.74] gonna play a little Connect four in a
[225.63 -> 229.14] little bit that's gonna be fun
[226.74 -> 231.33] we I have a vehicle video packages for
[229.14 -> 233.58] you guys and then after the a little bit
[231.33 -> 235.77] of an ad break we are gonna do the first
[233.58 -> 237.69] ever kind of funny Nick and Amy bird box
[235.77 -> 239.43] challenge now I don't know what this is
[237.69 -> 241.92] because I haven't watched bird box and I
[239.43 -> 243.33] don't read the Internet but Annie said
[241.92 -> 246.48] Nick I'm gonna blindfold you and I said
[243.33 -> 247.44] full stop I'm I'm in red I'm in I don't
[246.48 -> 248.97] know what it's gonna be you have
[247.44 -> 250.41] something prepared for me today have a
[248.97 -> 252.93] little something prepared yeah I wanted
[250.41 -> 254.46] to do for a while okay and that's what's
[252.93 -> 257.85] exciting about this show I think it's a
[254.46 -> 260.58] new frontier it's a lot of the things
[257.85 -> 263.43] that we may have wanted to do on the
[260.58 -> 265.08] morning show but every morning show
[263.43 -> 266.03] starts at 11 a.m. and obviously it's
[265.08 -> 267.77] like really early
[266.03 -> 269.51] yeah the thing about this show that I
[267.77 -> 270.71] like is that we've always wanted to do
[269.51 -> 272.09] little bits we've always wanted to prep
[270.71 -> 274.13] little packages things like that but we
[272.09 -> 275.99] just were too lazy on the morning show
[274.13 -> 278.66] and then Tim came to both of a sadist
[275.99 -> 279.89] and was like look how about you why
[278.66 -> 281.18] don't you just take all that effort five
[279.89 -> 283.34] days a week put into one we'll see what
[281.18 -> 284.90] we get right and I was like can I put
[283.34 -> 287.00] wood paneling on there and rush post her
[284.90 -> 288.65] in the back and he was like yes you can
[287.00 -> 291.17] but he didn't approve the heat poster
[288.65 -> 293.66] well he think about the heat posters
[291.17 -> 295.25] it's a not so subtle jab at Greg for
[293.66 -> 297.41] losing for that question of course it is
[295.25 -> 298.40] and apparently he won the belt I don't
[297.41 -> 299.66] know what happened with that I wasn't
[298.40 -> 300.86] here for that I don't think it's true a
[299.66 -> 302.48] lot of people a lot of people on reddit
[300.86 -> 304.40] are just saying that Greg is a fake
[302.48 -> 305.48] paper champ sure and that I'm the real
[304.40 -> 307.66] champ and I have I was the
[305.48 -> 309.35] longest-running champ which is crazy
[307.66 -> 311.90] people were saying that there's lots of
[309.35 -> 315.89] fire happening stopped uploading there's
[311.90 -> 318.86] lag whatever is that where the bits is
[315.89 -> 320.87] that where like the wrestling show bits
[318.86 -> 322.46] is this where it'll continue on I mean
[320.87 -> 323.90] probably because here's the deal
[322.46 -> 325.31] Internet Explorer's we did that on
[323.90 -> 326.90] Monday that was phenomenal that's gonna
[325.31 -> 329.48] be pure shenanigans and that's gonna
[326.90 -> 330.89] that's probably I thought this was gonna
[329.48 -> 333.08] be the show that gets us taken down off
[330.89 -> 335.45] the internet I'm pretty sure when we
[333.08 -> 337.46] went to worldstar on that one I was like
[335.45 -> 339.17] old I see well what I love is that
[337.46 -> 340.31] people go like there was a time in our
[339.17 -> 343.28] lives where everyone's like Nick you
[340.31 -> 344.87] gotta just look maybe don't go full Nick
[343.28 -> 346.10] and now we've come full circle where
[344.87 -> 349.04] everyone's going full Nick
[346.10 -> 351.50] we got Tim Ragnarok we got Greg actually
[349.04 -> 353.54] performing undebatable like you're gonna
[351.50 -> 355.19] make us he's always like Sophie I'm so
[353.54 -> 356.42] sticky grid there's a great way for the
[355.19 -> 359.12] great Doug and I'm just gonna make a
[356.42 -> 361.55] place other it's a concentrated point
[359.12 -> 369.11] square enix Nintendo why is it blue
[361.55 -> 370.28] station at e3 no cabins on this show
[369.11 -> 372.31] he's in the room we have to we have to
[370.28 -> 375.11] oh right right how you doing make a dog
[372.31 -> 377.33] sweaty yeah yeah yeah you guys flip this
[375.11 -> 378.08] set fast you and Barrett did a fantastic
[377.33 -> 379.64] job
[378.08 -> 381.29] if this show works the way I want it to
[379.64 -> 383.18] work and I think it will because we
[381.29 -> 385.46] actually rehearsed it last night yeah we
[383.18 -> 387.89] did an actual honest-to-god run through
[385.46 -> 388.94] a weird which is weird and I'm not used
[387.89 -> 390.83] to this because for the longest time
[388.94 -> 392.03] kind of funny was all about like hey man
[390.83 -> 392.99] let's just we have like four people
[392.03 -> 395.87] working here Kevin had to do everything
[392.99 -> 398.65] right so we got in the mindset of let's
[395.87 -> 401.02] just take every barrier away
[398.65 -> 403.06] that could be like anything complicated
[401.02 -> 404.41] to getting the people what they want
[403.06 -> 406.03] mm-hmm and now we're like let's put all
[404.41 -> 407.89] those barriers back in let's put all the
[406.03 -> 410.02] hoops back in let's try hard let's make
[407.89 -> 411.52] good content and I'm going from I'm
[410.02 -> 412.60] fixing my mindset from I used to call
[411.52 -> 414.91] the morning show the garbage truck on
[412.60 -> 415.36] fire this is the greatest show on the
[414.91 -> 416.77] Internet
[415.36 -> 418.27] this is the best show on your flip it
[416.77 -> 419.08] around you understand that from one
[418.27 -> 420.28] extreme to the other

[756.04 -> 759.31] beautiful boys shower together
[757.30 -> 763.15] so this was expensive and so expensive
[759.31 -> 765.22] so I bend down again blood and I notice
[763.15 -> 767.20] I have a new roommate so I'm getting
[765.22 -> 768.43] accustomed to her showering habit I'm
[767.20 -> 770.95] like well you know what she does in
[768.43 -> 773.14] there or whatever and there's a there's
[770.95 -> 775.45] a there's she has a razor on the little
[773.14 -> 777.91] soap shower policy she has a razor on
[775.45 -> 781.69] the show on the soap holder oh [ __ ] the
[777.91 -> 784.54] razor fell off it's just not at a dog
[781.69 -> 786.76] angle don't and all I did was bend down
[784.54 -> 789.28] rub against it and it kind of sliced me
[786.76 -> 791.05] and I'm just bleeding so at this point
[789.28 -> 793.06] it's like this blood isn't stopping yeah
[791.05 -> 793.98] and I look in the razor and my skin's in
[793.06 -> 796.99] there
[793.98 -> 799.45] i'ma pop clean out her razor when I'm
[796.99 -> 800.83] out talking and it's just blood and it's
[799.45 -> 802.93] so unlike when it's just gonna stop
[800.83 -> 805.27] bleeding so then I get some toilet paper
[802.93 -> 808.36] I get a [ __ ] load of toilet paper and I
[805.27 -> 809.08] start just holding it right yeah try to
[808.36 -> 811.36] stop the bleeding
[809.08 -> 813.64] it doesn't stop the blood does not stop
[811.36 -> 814.69] rushing out so I finally get out of the
[813.64 -> 816.40] shower and it's like all right I'm
[814.69 -> 818.32] trying to hold this uh this toilet paper
[816.40 -> 820.66] and get out and I don't want to stain my
[818.32 -> 821.98] towels or whatever because lord knows
[820.66 -> 824.59] what's on there right like there's
[821.98 -> 827.50] enough just different fluids on there
[824.59 -> 829.99] and so I'm trying to stop the bleeding
[827.50 -> 831.76] and it doesn't stop so I essentially I'm
[829.99 -> 833.80] wearing my me undies and I gotta have a
[831.76 -> 835.93] big wad of toilet paper in between my
[833.80 -> 837.66] leg and me and ease right yeah I'm just
[835.93 -> 839.56] kind of trying to stop the bleeding and
[837.66 -> 840.73] I don't have anything that's how that
[839.56 -> 843.10] used to do a World War two by the way
[840.73 -> 846.01] they strap on me undies and just yeah
[843.10 -> 847.57] what's this stuff this was really in
[846.01 -> 849.58] World War two they were yeah yeah so
[847.57 -> 851.11] then I sound like I gotta go get some
[849.58 -> 852.10] gauze I gotta get to do something about
[851.11 -> 853.57] this because I don't want to be dealing
[852.10 -> 855.01] with this all night and then so I just
[853.57 -> 857.29] walk to the store and like yeah so it's
[855.01 -> 860.14] it's pretty bad man there was a cut
[857.29 -> 862.63] about that long that just would not stop
[860.14 -> 864.67] Lee dude I learned the hard way a long
[862.63 -> 866.32] time ago to only cut up and down every
[864.67 -> 868.06] side to side that's just the way you go
[866.32 -> 869.50] well so I'm worried about it because
[868.06 -> 871.24] there's an episode of a thousand ways to
[869.50 -> 873.76] die that I remember watching where a
[871.24 -> 876.34] woman dies by a woman expectation having
[873.76 -> 879.25] used a razor yet had a bit of rust on it
[876.34 -> 881.32] and the brush got into her blood I could
[879.25 -> 883.78] she's just a rust mutant yeah yeah she's
[881.32 -> 885.70] gonna die she's just she's just she's
[883.78 -> 886.99] had she's has to go stand out in a field
[885.70 -> 887.62] until she where there's a way yes
[886.99 -> 889.72] exactly
[887.62 -> 891.70] very horrifying so that's my brother
[889.72 -> 892.87] right now man you can't [ __ ] em it's
[891.70 -> 895.75] right you get lockjaw I had to get some
[892.87 -> 898.21] band-aids with some neosporin kind of a
[895.75 -> 899.23] cleaned out the wound I had to burn it
[898.21 -> 902.70] off as well
[899.23 -> 905.95] or you had to cauterize it yeah yeah oh
[902.70 -> 908.89] great save that and II got statistic did

[925.89 -> 930.42] different sort of games right sure
[928.32 -> 931.44] different you know fun family sort of
[930.42 -> 933.00] things just have fun
[931.44 -> 934.59] we're in mom and dad's basement they've

[938.10 -> 941.88] love me a theme song yeah love me a
[940.26 -> 944.58] thing what are we playing we're playing
[941.88 -> 946.11] a game called Connect for what I don't
[944.58 -> 948.18] even know if I can say it can we say it
[946.11 -> 950.16] I don't know because but here's the
[948.18 -> 953.67] problem right because this map this
[950.16 -> 955.95] gives me I'm I have PTSD from the mr.
[953.67 -> 959.04] bucket phenomenon right right as you all
[955.95 -> 961.02] know we played an old clip of an old mr.
[959.04 -> 963.42] bucket commercial yeah and boy they
[961.02 -> 965.61] [ __ ] us boy they [ __ ] us good we're
[963.42 -> 967.83] not they turned us over and we're like
[965.61 -> 970.62] no loop we're going in yeah
[967.83 -> 973.14] so it's and they didn't even like D
[970.62 -> 974.58] monetize the video they Sheamus robbery
[973.14 -> 976.08] we couldn't there was a while where
[974.58 -> 978.33] people are like it's weird that we're
[976.08 -> 979.77] streaming all the shows on kind of fun
[978.33 -> 984.06] the kind of funny games channel we
[979.77 -> 985.77] watching money might be recently Artie
[984.06 -> 989.13] why are we watching the game of a greggy
[985.77 -> 990.57] show on the games Channel and all of us
[989.13 -> 993.15] you damn sure we're not allowed to talk
[990.57 -> 994.77] about it the legally speaking mr. bucket
[993.15 -> 996.66] [ __ ] us so [ __ ] Hasbro's got to
[994.77 -> 998.25] when we went to court and we were in
[996.66 -> 1000.02] front of the judge and mr. bucket was
[998.25 -> 1002.18] there they said how do you police a we
[1000.02 -> 1004.16] got [ __ ] your bucket is [ __ ] us and
[1002.18 -> 1005.39] Mister and they say guilty kind of funny
[1004.16 -> 1006.68] and then the Hasbro's are in the back
[1005.39 -> 1008.36] just kind of with their arms crossed
[1006.68 -> 1009.89] doing that we have to be we have to make
[1008.36 -> 1012.77] sure we don't do anything on this show
[1009.89 -> 1015.26] utilizing anyone else's footage at all
[1012.77 -> 1017.00] ever yeah until the next segment so I
[1015.26 -> 1018.53] saw I have a theme song that I wrote
[1017.00 -> 1020.39] okay because I you know I love me a
[1018.53 -> 1022.01] theme song we love video transitions and
[1020.39 -> 1024.08] I was like should I prepare this for the
[1022.01 -> 1025.94] video you know you what let's record the
[1024.08 -> 1027.59] theme song live yeah first step we got
[1025.94 -> 1030.80] to let everyone be a part of this yeah
[1027.59 -> 1032.63] exactly yeah so again we probably would
[1030.80 -> 1033.80] have used an old Kinect for commercial
[1032.63 -> 1036.47] yeah easily we could have probably sold
[1033.80 -> 1038.30] Kinect for but okay and to be fair we're
[1036.47 -> 1040.85] not saying that Kinect for is a villain
[1038.30 -> 1043.31] here we're speaking for them we're just
[1040.85 -> 1044.51] what the villain isn't Airlines I'm just
[1043.31 -> 1045.92] terrified I'm sure can I'm sure if we
[1044.51 -> 1047.12] reached out to mr. connected mr. four
[1045.92 -> 1048.20] they would have like you guys can
[1047.12 -> 1049.22] totally use a commercial it's totally
[1048.20 -> 1050.69] fine and that could have been fun
[1049.22 -> 1053.84] because it goes to the motif of the 80s
[1050.69 -> 1056.00] but we're too scared yeah and II where
[1053.84 -> 1059.00] when there's a need necessity is
[1056.00 -> 1060.77] mother of invention so well let's hear
[1059.00 -> 1063.08] what's the theme song so I'm gonna got
[1060.77 -> 1065.81] to change up the lyrics a little bit so
[1063.08 -> 1067.16] just follow along and and then next week
[1065.81 -> 1070.28] what I'm hoping to have is maybe some
[1067.16 -> 1076.04] added drums to it we just keep adding
[1070.28 -> 1078.50] maybe a tambourine next time maybe
[1076.04 -> 1081.17] triangle okay yeah that was the bill
[1078.50 -> 1083.09] those nerds in the pit I was been nerd I
[1081.17 -> 1085.55] was the drum major all right guys ready
[1083.09 -> 1132.65] to get it right here's the theme song
[1085.55 -> 1134.24] for that's the theme song
[1132.65 -> 1136.28] nailed it that's the theme song first
[1134.24 -> 1139.43] take ur first take that was great like
[1136.28 -> 1141.02] how do I even fantastic the joys of
[1139.43 -> 1141.62] rehearsing a show look at that that went
[1141.02 -> 1144.77] off without a hitch
[1141.62 -> 1146.54] oh here the end audience this is just
[1144.77 -> 1147.77] the best show they've ever watched they
[1146.54 -> 1149.33] have no idea how much time and effort
[1147.77 -> 1150.98] and pain and struggle I had to make
[1149.33 -> 1153.64] these walls in Photoshop yeah and then I
[1150.98 -> 1155.84] had to deal with my brother Kevin
[1153.64 -> 1157.40] because I forgot the first verse I
[1155.84 -> 1158.63] needed to rerecord the first verse
[1157.40 -> 1160.19] really quick so it wasn't the first take
[1158.63 -> 1162.65] okay and I'm gonna splice all together
[1160.19 -> 1178.19] it'll exactly record at where there's no
[1162.65 -> 1179.87] trains all right that's good that will
[1178.19 -> 1184.07] spice it in no figure it out thanks guys
[1179.87 -> 1186.26] I will say your your ability to just
[1184.07 -> 1188.16] sandwich words in there is unparalleled
[1186.26 -> 1190.35] now you remember the boy

[1194.91 -> 1198.39] play now yeah we're gonna play again oh
[1196.35 -> 1199.53] yeah you got the game yeah okay
[1198.39 -> 1201.21] connects between three and five it's a
[1199.53 -> 1203.82] different game okay got it can I say it

[1203.82 -> 1208.05] error oh I'm sorry sorry Connect four
[1206.13 -> 1209.82] just FYI we're not yeah using your
[1208.05 -> 1211.23] license or property and I'll be really
[1209.82 -> 1212.79] honest with you Nick yeah I'll be very
[1211.23 -> 1216.30] very honest with you when we were
[1212.79 -> 1217.68] setting up the set yeah when Barrett and
[1216.30 -> 1219.63] Kim were setting up the set and I was
[1217.68 -> 1222.15] like prepping my stuff you said do you
[1219.63 -> 1224.67] have Connect four and I said yeah and it
[1222.15 -> 1227.52] was still in my backpack unopened so I
[1224.67 -> 1229.20] haven't set this up yet okay but what
[1227.52 -> 1230.85] are your that what are these things I'm

[1237.90 -> 1241.26] lot harder but it's not yeah I think

[1348.93 -> 1355.77] here okay all right okay let's see
[1354.09 -> 1357.15] so for audio listeners Nick put it right
[1355.77 -> 1358.47] in the middle right no [ __ ] it I didn't
[1357.15 -> 1360.33] do any research on this I'm sure there's
[1358.47 -> 1361.80] a strategy for connected there are seven
[1360.33 -> 1363.33] roads yeah let me know what the strategy
[1361.80 -> 1365.91] is from gonna write in the night lock it
[1363.33 -> 1369.84] up [ __ ] it up thinking of where I
[1365.91 -> 1371.49] should it's not it's not great for the
[1369.84 -> 1374.40] auto listeners when you take this long
[1371.49 -> 1376.71] until we flip with the thing in there
[1374.40 -> 1379.08] you know I'm thinking Nick yeah I'm
[1376.71 -> 1382.82] gonna go doggy take you right right
[1379.08 -> 1382.82] there okay so I get to put one more in
[1399.65 -> 1402.72] [Music]
[1409.25 -> 1414.78] so we're done okay okay
[1412.17 -> 1416.61] well the premise is every week we'll
[1414.78 -> 1418.62] each put down a piece got it okay we
[1416.61 -> 1420.36] will create the longest connect for
[1418.62 -> 1422.28] match in the history of the world this
[1420.36 -> 1423.21] makes a lot more sense yeah yeah yeah so
[1422.28 -> 1424.38] now that's cool
[1423.21 -> 1425.61] here's here's my prediction you should I
[1424.38 -> 1427.62] give you my prediction so just remember
[1425.61 -> 1429.12] where the pieces are everybody and then
[1427.62 -> 1430.92] you can you can kind of keep record at
[1429.12 -> 1432.57] home yeah I was gonna say my prediction
[1430.92 -> 1434.16] is that this falls over all the pieces
[1432.57 -> 1435.75] fall out and this is actually the
[1434.16 -> 1437.19] longest game of Connect four because we
[1435.75 -> 1438.36] either lose the Kinect for what happens
[1437.19 -> 1440.58] if we lose it we just buy another one to
[1438.36 -> 1442.86] start over well if we could do that and
[1440.58 -> 1444.80] then we can look at prior archive
[1442.86 -> 1447.80] footage I think if we lose it
[1444.80 -> 1449.24] I think if we if we lose it or if it
[1447.80 -> 1450.83] yeah that could be a segment we can do
[1449.24 -> 1452.75] that or if we lose it we just have to
[1450.83 -> 1454.67] start over okay we have to call connect
[1452.75 -> 1455.90] me to 35 the gorge just right what good
[1454.67 -> 1457.76] to call it connect to the agreement you
[1455.90 -> 1459.56] like working here do you like not being
[1457.76 -> 1462.23] in prison because connect four will sue
[1459.56 -> 1463.49] your ass that's right Elsie June 3 or 5
[1462.23 -> 1464.90] all right do a great time like a nice
[1463.49 -> 1466.37] leg when everyone segment next stop
[1464.90 -> 1470.33] ladies and gentlemen we have a fun show
[1466.37 -> 1471.62] planned for you too Jay Tim did this
[1470.33 -> 1473.18] amazing thing over the break I don't
[1471.62 -> 1475.13] know if you follow at Tim Geddes on
[1473.18 -> 1476.90] either Instagram or Twitter if you do
[1475.13 -> 1478.72] he's verified Greg's not rub that Greg
[1476.90 -> 1481.94] stupid face next time he doesn't show
[1478.72 -> 1483.92] the Tim did this great video the other
[1481.94 -> 1486.02] day where he was like hey here's how I
[1483.92 -> 1487.82] think Avengers end game should end
[1486.02 -> 1489.52] basically goes through it in less than a
[1487.82 -> 1492.80] minute it's really cool it's really hype
[1489.52 -> 1494.72] let's take a look at it right now so
[1492.80 -> 1497.18] this is how Avengers end game should end
[1494.72 -> 1498.74] we get through all the sad stuff Tony
[1497.18 -> 1500.75] and cap have made up the good guys
[1498.74 -> 1503.54] figure out how to unsnap everyone and
[1500.75 -> 1505.46] now it is epic final battle time Tony
[1503.54 -> 1507.35] looks at star-lord and is like hey you
[1505.46 -> 1511.91] got that Zune ready then we get a
[1507.35 -> 1517.84] recreation of this scene mr. stark and
[1511.91 -> 1517.84] then cap is all alike Avengers
[1518.00 -> 1523.86] but he finally actually says assemble
[1521.34 -> 1527.52] then tony is like we'll hit it over the
[1523.86 -> 1528.78] PA boom one by one we see all the heroes
[1527.52 -> 1531.36] powering up and fighting together
[1528.78 -> 1534.27] culminating in a reverse shot of the og
[1531.36 -> 1536.22] Avengers 360 shot but instead it's
[1534.27 -> 1538.41] Thanos looking around as he's surrounded
[1536.22 -> 1540.69] by the original six Avengers but then it
[1538.41 -> 1542.22] keeps going and it's like all of the
[1540.69 -> 1544.77] heroes and then it is the most epic
[1542.22 -> 1547.53] fight scene of all time
[1544.77 -> 1549.69] then everything stops and freezes and
[1547.53 -> 1552.03] you just see cut off here so come back
[1549.69 -> 1554.79] to us for a quick so you get the picture
[1552.03 -> 1555.99] really great job hello a lot of people
[1554.79 -> 1558.66] in the audience have probably seen this
[1555.99 -> 1560.28] already yeah and I was a really cool
[1558.66 -> 1561.60] idea I was back home actually when he
[1560.28 -> 1564.39] posted it I think it's great I think
[1561.60 -> 1566.88] it's 90% there I think we can do better
[1564.39 -> 1568.38] you have other I see I have a few other
[1566.88 -> 1570.54] ideas that I thought not said not to
[1568.38 -> 1573.60] denigrate the man the myth the legend
[1570.54 -> 1575.70] the pure one 34:30 baby blue eyes second
[1573.60 -> 1578.22] best blue eyes Tim Geddes but I think we
[1575.70 -> 1580.73] can do better so I made my own
[1578.22 -> 1583.47] predictions video of how I think
[1580.73 -> 1585.27] Avengers end game should end let's watch
[1583.47 -> 1589.23] it right now okay I'm interested in this
[1585.27 -> 1591.21] one so this is how Avengers end game
[1589.23 -> 1593.94] should end we get through all the sad
[1591.21 -> 1597.48] stuff Tony and cap have made up and then
[1593.94 -> 1600.78] the finger-blasting starts everyone gets
[1597.48 -> 1602.36] in on it starts off with Iron Man Iron
[1600.78 -> 1604.89] Man's who wants some nano BOTS
[1602.36 -> 1607.14] finger-blasting and then Falcons like
[1604.89 -> 1609.06] I'm up top yo is this where the finger
[1607.14 -> 1610.56] blasting is and then Scarlet Witch is
[1609.06 -> 1612.93] like if you guys are gonna do some
[1610.56 -> 1617.30] finger blasting which wants to watch and
[1612.93 -> 1617.30] then we get a recreation of this see
[1629.45 -> 1634.66] and then it keeps going and it's like
[1632.03 -> 1637.01] all of the heroes and it's the most epic
[1634.66 -> 1640.04] finger-blasting scene of all time and
[1637.01 -> 1643.22] then it just stops because everyone's
[1640.04 -> 1655.31] kind of sore from the from all the
[1643.22 -> 1657.47] plastic so bitten okay right so there it
[1655.31 -> 1659.84] is so I feel like that element is what
[1657.47 -> 1660.95] we needed to add back in to Tim's video
[1659.84 -> 1662.30] do you think we could just merge is
[1660.95 -> 1663.89] there a way to just add the merge of the
[1662.30 -> 1665.27] videos on Twitter it's possible there's
[1663.89 -> 1667.70] a lot more different than I expected it
[1665.27 -> 1668.81] to be Wow does it take it's like the
[1667.70 -> 1670.97] think about Marvel that you understand
[1668.81 -> 1672.77] is they subvert expectations you think
[1670.97 -> 1674.63] it's gonna be one way snap they do
[1672.77 -> 1677.60] multiverse every perspective than I
[1674.63 -> 1679.70] expected but I aim and Kevin Feige you
[1677.60 -> 1680.99] know keep it in mind right bit of my to
[1679.70 -> 1682.34] the future my favorite thing to come out

[1959.91 -> 1964.98] sort of dalliance is you have maybe our
[1961.71 -> 1966.90] dalliance diet coke and sugar-free Red
[1964.98 -> 1968.37] Bull I love Diet Coke and I love sugar

[1968.37 -> 1972.57] for them you don't really sort of a
[1969.69 -> 1974.88] branch out beverage wise yeah I on the
[1972.57 -> 1978.71] other hand and obviously I'm a gamer an
[1974.88 -> 1982.50] eSports gamer and we love carbonated
[1978.71 -> 1985.17] caffeinated sugary beverage you guys are
[1982.50 -> 1987.93] the next generation yeah so with no
[1985.17 -> 1990.75] further ado okay Kevin I'd like to
[1987.93 -> 1995.46] present to everybody the bird box
[1990.75 -> 1998.06] blindfold beverage bonanza that worked
[1995.46 -> 2001.36] so well I can't believe how well holy
[1998.06 -> 2002.95] [ __ ] I can't believe that was incredible
[2001.36 -> 2004.69] I gotta sleep last night cuz that
[2002.95 -> 2007.81] graphic the whole thought of the park
[2004.69 -> 2009.94] alright so I got a whole truck so so I'm
[2007.81 -> 2011.47] gonna taste a bunch of stuff right but
[2009.94 -> 2012.67] isn't the whole concept of bird box that
[2011.47 -> 2014.32] Sandra Bullock's like walking on a
[2012.67 -> 2015.61] forest can't see [ __ ] just like feel
[2014.32 -> 2018.10] around oh yeah yeah yeah
[2015.61 -> 2021.94] so you're blindfolded you're we're bird
[2018.10 -> 2023.80] boxing you yeah well the way hon what's
[2021.94 -> 2026.17] up but it's a but are there cans in
[2023.80 -> 2027.58] there am I seeing labels oh they're all
[2026.17 -> 2028.75] numbered oh they're all numbered
[2027.58 -> 2030.01] Nicholas well I don't know what any of
[2028.75 -> 2031.54] these oh my god you don't know what
[2030.01 -> 2033.13] anything is so that's where the key know
[2031.54 -> 2034.72] what anything is it'll look don't look
[2033.13 -> 2037.09] I'm a little look okay look
[2034.72 -> 2039.31] so I have to be blindfolded for the bit
[2037.09 -> 2041.14] and also probably for SEO I imagine oh
[2039.31 -> 2042.52] yeah of course yeah so the whole thing
[2041.14 -> 2045.43] is like sure you could be blindfolded
[2042.52 -> 2046.75] and in bird box the movies about Sandra
[2045.43 -> 2048.55] Bullock and she's like you know you have
[2046.75 -> 2049.84] to be blindfolded you have to guide your
[2048.55 -> 2051.46] friends having your walking blindfold
[2049.84 -> 2052.60] around the world or whatever okay but
[2051.46 -> 2054.88] for us we're just like what if we just
[2052.60 -> 2056.86] drink drinks you know yeah what if we
[2054.88 -> 2058.51] drink sugary drinks oh no son I want you
[2056.86 -> 2059.74] I'm trusting you yeah because every time
[2058.51 -> 2061.75] I blindfold myself here at this office
[2059.74 -> 2064.39] Gregg comes and rubs his [ __ ] taint or
[2061.75 -> 2066.79] a sweaty armpit oh yeah [ __ ] gum body
[2064.39 -> 2068.14] against me no we're gonna be good tree
[2066.79 -> 2070.27] trusting right now yeah tree trust
[2068.14 -> 2072.04] retreat run on the blindfold but on the
[2070.27 -> 2074.77] blindfold okay make sure you can't see a
[2072.04 -> 2074.95] goddang can't see anything okay here we
[2074.77 -> 2076.39] go
[2074.95 -> 2078.49] if someone hits me in the face I swear
[2076.39 -> 2079.69] to God oh I'm not get you 10 times no

[2079.69 -> 2082.39] face you won't be hit anywhere right
[2080.71 -> 2083.86] weird it's weird to take here's the
[2082.39 -> 2085.45] thing it's weird to take your eye side
[2083.86 -> 2086.95] away because my hearing just got like 10
[2085.45 -> 2088.90] times better yeah I can hear Kevin
[2086.95 -> 2090.67] cracking his knuckles and I can hear
[2088.90 -> 2091.90] it's identical it's [ __ ] crazy

[3062.36 -> 3067.19] back in college radio was integral to my
[3064.79 -> 3069.49] life we all know Tyler Cocalico used to
[3067.19 -> 3071.95] host on ESPN radio show
[3069.49 -> 3073.48] and it was non-stop for me so it was
[3071.95 -> 3076.63] like sports radio sports radio sports

[3185.29 -> 3189.49] a lot of controversy right a lot of
[3187.45 -> 3192.01] controversy so what they say in England

[3192.01 -> 3195.52] watch a lot of the Great British baking
[3193.45 -> 3198.67] show they said controversy so they're
[3195.52 -> 3200.20] like a British relish guy so he just
