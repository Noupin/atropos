# ADR-0002: Trial & Entitlement Model

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2024-06-01

## Context

We need a predictable trial experience that allows prospective users to test uploads while preventing abuse across multiple devices.

## Decision

Implement a per-device trial granting up to three video uploads. Bind trials to the device fingerprint captured by the desktop app. Define an "entitled" subscriber as any account with an active Stripe subscription or unused trial balance whose entitlement JWT is valid for the requested scope.

## Consequences

- Trial consumption and remaining balance must be stored in Workers KV keyed by device fingerprint.
- The worker must enforce trial limits and mark devices as ineligible once the quota is exhausted.
- Desktop and Python services must present entitlement JWTs for every privileged request; absence or expiration results in denial.
